**object-oriented programming(OOP)** was invented to solve two problems:
- what is a natural way to represent real-world 'thing' in code
- how can we organize code to make it easier to understand,test and extend

**Polymorphism** : classes have the same methods and can use them interchangeably.
- Pro: **reduce cognitive load** by allowing the people using related things to ignore their differences

**The difference between Arguments and Parameters**
- parameters are part of the definition
- arguments are given when the function is called 

**Arguments**
- **\*args**: captures any 'extra' values passed to the function that don't line up with named parameter
- **\*\*kwargs** :captures any 'extra' named parameters

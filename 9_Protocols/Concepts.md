**Mock Objects** : Temporary replacements
Define a **__call__** method so that **instance** can be called like functions

**Protocols**: is a rule  that specifies how programs can tell Python to do specific things at specific moments
**context manager**: rely on two methods '_enter_' and '_exit_'
**Decorator**: wrap one function with another

**Iterator protocol**: is a version of the iterator design pattern:
-  an object use '__iter__' method to create an iterator object
- the iterator object must have a __next__ method, which must return a value each time it is called. when there are no more
values to return, it must raise a StopIteration exception.
